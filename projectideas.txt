1. Create plugin to auto push to github
- Switch working directory to current file
- Open powershell inside vim
- Add, commit, and push

- Determine the comment syntax for the current file (if any), and let users
  define a key to use to comment/uncomment lines in their vimrc. If none is
  present, assign one.
