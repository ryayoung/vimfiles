# My Vim Configuration
Here's my entire vim configuration, including all plugins and vimrc. I use Plug as my plugin manager.

#### A couple notes:
- In addition to my vimrc, I do a lot of my configuration in my ```/plugin``` folder, where you'll find ```sets.vim```, ```maps.vim```, and more!
- If you use my configuration, the ```CheatSheet.md``` file will be VERY helpful as you learn my leader key commands.
- At the bottom of the vimrc, my quick access directories and files are custom to my workflow. You'll want to change these to meet your needs!
