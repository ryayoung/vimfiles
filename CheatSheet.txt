CHEAT SHEET FOR KEY MAPPINGS
- Use the command, "<Space>?" to quickly access this file at any time.
- The following commands are defined in vimrc and maps.vim. NOTE: 4 of the following maps conflict with Vim commands you're used to: mm, mM, mn, mN

------- LEADER KEY -------
Leader Key: <Space>
- Leader key is a globally defined key which will be the first key you press for any custom mappings you see here. Vim's own commands take up almost the entire keyboard, so by having the leader key be the first thing pressed in all your mappings, you've freed up unlimited real estate! The leader key is defined near line 30 in the vimrc (press "<Space>vrc" to see it).
